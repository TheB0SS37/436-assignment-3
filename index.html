        I decided to include this item in my portfolio since it was the first
        coding assignment we were tasked with. I was excited to be hands on
        finally as that's typically the way I learn the best, which is by
        actually using what I am learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned about using both Plotly and Tableau during this assignment
        (and also what chorpleth means!). I also learned how to do a random
        scatter while doing the beeswarm plot in Tableau.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will help me out of class, since making visualizations has always
        been part of what I want at my job. After this, I have some new skills I
        can use at work, and a leg up for when I want to learn a new type of
        visualization software
      </p>
      <p>
        Data manipulation and data structures have always piqued my interest, so
        finding new ways to do the same data task was interesting for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        The above visualization was the first visualization I made for this
        assignment with Plotly. It was pretty easy once I figured out how I
        wanted to use the dataset, which was create an aggregated list of all
        the sums of totals spent and received by the countries.

        This my Tableau rendition of the same visualization. I couldn't figure
        out how to directly sum each country's donations, so I split the
        dashboard in to two separate choropleths.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was my beeswarm plot of donations sent through the decades which
        was made in Plotly. It was not too difficult to make, however I wish it
        was easier to customize the options.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, this was the Tableau version of the beeswarm plot. This version
        was much easier to make, and I was also able to add two different types
        of encodings for the donation amounts by using both area and also the
        vertical position within the visualization.
