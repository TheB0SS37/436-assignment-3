      <p>
        I decided to include this item in my portfolio since it was the first
        coding assignment we were tasked with. I was excited to be hands on
        finally as that's typically the way I learn the best, which is by
        actually using what I am learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned about using both Plotly and Tableau during this assignment
        (and also what chorpleth means!). I also learned how to do a random
        scatter while doing the beeswarm plot in Tableau.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will help me out of class, since making visualizations has always
        been part of what I want at my job. After this, I have some new skills I
        can use at work, and a leg up for when I want to learn a new type of
        visualization software
      </p>
      <p>
        Data manipulation and data structures have always piqued my interest, so
        finding new ways to do the same data task was interesting for me.
      </p>

      <img src="assets/choropleth_difference.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
      <p>
        The above visualization was the first visualization I made for this
        assignment with Plotly. It was pretty easy once I figured out how I
        wanted to use the dataset, which was create an aggregated list of all
        the sums of totals spent and received by the countries.
      </p>

      <hr class="align-self-center hr hr-blurry w-50" />

      <img src="assets/tableau_choropleth.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
      <p>
        This my Tableau rendition of the same visualization. I couldn't figure
        out how to directly sum each country's donations, so I split the
        dashboard in to two separate choropleths.
      </p>

      <hr class="align-self-center hr hr-blurry w-50" />

      <img src="assets/beeswarm_by_decade.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
      <p>
        This was my beeswarm plot of donations sent through the decades which
        was made in Plotly. It was not too difficult to make, however I wish it
        was easier to customize the options.
      </p>
      <hr class="align-self-center hr hr-blurry w-50" />
      <img src="assets/tableau_beeswarm.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
      <p>
        Lastly, this was the Tableau version of the beeswarm plot. This version
        was much easier to make, and I was also able to add two different types
        of encodings for the donation amounts by using both area and also the
        vertical position within the visualization.

      <!-- Marks and Channels -->
      <p class="display-5">Marks and Channels Reflection</p>
      <p class="lead">Chapter 5 In-Class Activity</p>
      <p>
        I chose this in-class activity to reflect on since it was an important
        topic for this class. Understanding the marks and channels that go into
        a visualization is key to creating something that is succint and easy to
        interpret.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this assignment, I learned how to identify marks and channels,
        however, I am not sure if I was completely correct for all of my
        guesses. If we were to do more guided sessions for this topic, it would
        be quite helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will innately use marks and channels in my career whenever I need to
        make a visualization. It will also be helpful to know what the most
        effective channels are for different types of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wind visualization shown later sparked my curiosity, since I had
        never seen a map visualization like it. It is also not very common to
        see tilt as a channel for magnitude.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/ch_5_inclass/narks_channels.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
      <p>The above image was helpful during identification.</p>
      <hr class="align-self-center hr hr-blurry w-50" />
      <img src="assets/ch_5_inclass/electoral.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
      <p>
        This visualization was not very good, 3D size is not a good channel for
        magnitude in this case.
      </p>
      <hr class="align-self-center hr hr-blurry w-50" />
      <img src="assets/ch_5_inclass/genome.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
      <p>
        This visualization was a mess, but it was a good example of connections.
      </p>
      <hr class="align-self-center hr hr-blurry w-50" />
      <img src="assets/ch_5_inclass/wind.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
      <p>
        This was my favorite visualization of the bunch, it used the marks and
        channels effectively. Using tilt was also interesting for me.
      </p>

      <p class="display-5">Group Project Reflection + Refinement</p>
      <p>
        It was a simple choice for me to choose to refine the group project
        since it was the most difficult assignment in the class. Collaboration
        is a difficult but necessary skill in this field, and effectively
        working in a team was a great learning experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this assignment, I learned about D3.js the most. It is an
        extremely powerful JavaScript library and I enjoyed using it despite the
        learning curve. It was performant and had templates I was able to
        extend.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was curious about zoom interactions in data visualizations. I was also
        curious about information on demand, and I was able to make a system for
        it in my visualizations.
      </p>
      <hr class="align-self-center hr hr-blurry w-50" />
      <p class="display-5">Group Project Best Practices</p>
      <p>
        Our team during the group project was effective in creating a refined
        project. We had a single project manager, two programmers, a technical
        writer, and a data engineer role.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project manager role is key in any development team, since their
        task is to prevent the other members from having to focus on anything
        else but their task. Having a person to talk with the customer
        (Professor) to get deadlines and tasks, while also preventing scope
        creep. They should also be communicating with the team to track
        progress. This is necessary in case other members are needed to help on
        aspects of the development process that are lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The programmers are what actually make the product, so it should be the
        largest group of people in a development team. Typically, one of the
        programmers should also be designated as a tech lead. The tech lead
        should be the person making major decisions such as tech stack, code
        formatting and style guides, and assigning work to the other programmers
        based on their skills. It is also their job to relay to the project
        manager status updates based on their work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technical writer role is under appreciated in the development world.
        Not having a technical writer causes a significant amount of technical
        debt in the long run. Technical writers should be deeply involved in the
        development process, but not actually be writing any code. It is
        important for them to focus on updating documents and making sure any
        new developers can easily understand what they are working with in a
        timely fashion. Technical writers should aim to cover as much of the
        code as possible. They should also be able to describe overall system
        structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, the data engineer is important to get the programmers what they
        need to make the visualizations or product. Manipulating data to be in a
        viable format can be difficult which is why data engineers should be
        working with the programmers constantly. They should be completely
        focused on making things such as aggregation pipelines, queries, and
        models to allow the programmers to focus on visuals.

      <p class="display-5">Best Worst Bake off Reflection</p>
      <p>
        This was my favorite activity (although I sadly missed the deadline and
        felt rushed for my worst visualization post (my fault)). It was
        interesting to see just how bad a visualization can get. I found my bad
        visualization by browsing through the r/dataisugly subreddit. I found my
        good visualization simply by searching for "Best Visualizations" on
        google.
      </p>
      <p class="display-6">Worst</p>
      <img src="assets/banana.webp" class="img-fluid" />
      <p>I appreciated this vizualization's background.</p>
      <hr class="align-self-center hr hr-blurry w-50" />
      <p class="display-6">Best</p>
      <img src="assets/best_viz.webp" class="img-fluid" />
      <p>I thought colors on this were pretty.</p>
